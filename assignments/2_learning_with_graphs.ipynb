    "The simplest classification method consists in ignoring the citation graph and try to classify the papers using only the features. In this case, the problem is viewed as a standard classification task. To train our classifier we will select a few nodes in our graph for training and fit a [logistic regression classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression) on them. To avoid overfitting to the test set when we do hyperparameter tuning, we will also select a validation set. And finally, we will test our classifier on the rest of the nodes. **Hint:** Use `sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression`."
